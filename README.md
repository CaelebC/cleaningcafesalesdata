# Cleaning Cafe Sales Dataset
This repository is for practicing data cleaning for a Cafe Sales dataset retrieved from Kaggle. The dataset was uploaded by Ahmed Mohamed from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training

My goal with this is to be able to clean the dataset and create a simple visualization to represent the most profitable and most purchased item in the cafe.
